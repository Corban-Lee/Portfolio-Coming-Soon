# Portfolio-Coming-Soon
 A bespoke-made "under construction" notice website, to inform users of my upcoming portfolio website. It includes a mail list sign-up so that users can stay informed of future updates.

 The webserver runs on port `5000`. This value is accessible for change in both the `docker-compose.yml` and the `Dockerfile`.
